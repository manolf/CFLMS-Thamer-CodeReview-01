		<h2>Why the Austrian Alps are one of the most beautiful and popular mountains to visit</h2>
		<address>&#169;Richard Campbell</address>

		<article>
		<br>The spectacular Austrian Alps stretch throughout the whole country. Not many people know it, but Austria holds the biggest territory of the Alps of all the eight Alpine countries – a whopping 28.7% of the total mountain range. It is full of spectacular peaks, vast green meadows, and magnificent valleys that were formed during the last Ice Age. 

		The Austrian Alps is a popular destination for nature lovers. The lowlands of the Alps are home to deer, stags, foxes, badgers, and martens. The highlands create a perfect habitat for chamois, groundhogs, eagles and mountain jackdaws. Recently, the Austrian mountains have once again become home to a small bear population.

		<br><br>The Austrian Alps are popular all year round. During the summer, it becomes one of the most popular hiking destinations in Europe. With over 26000.0km of trails, it’s a great place to explore the mountains and creates a lot of options for hikers of any experience level. During the winter, the Austrian mountains are perfect for skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing and other amazing winter activities.

		<strong>Hiking in Austria</strong>  is a great way to experience nature and beautiful landscapes, a fact that people have known for millennia. One of the Alps’ most famous and ancient inhabitants is Ötzi the Iceman. While not a recreational hiker per se, Ötzi did live in the Alps some 5,300 years ago. There are also alpine routes in Austria that date back to the Bronze Age. The Romans also left their mark on the mountains, creating many roads that criss-crossed the range, and some of the old mule tracks, known as “Saumpfade”, are also now used as hiking trails.

		<br>The modern culture of organized hiking in the Alps can be dated back to the creation of the Austrian Alpine Club. The Club was founded in Vienna in 1862. Although it drew inspiration from the London Alpine Club, it was the first Alpine Club of its type that existed on the European continent and certainly the first organisation of its kind to exist in the Alps.

		Today the club has over a half a million members, charts 24000.0km of paths, and boasts 234 alpine huts.

		Wherever you go in the Alps, you’ll be guaranteed <strong> spectacular scenery, epic peaks, pristine alpine lakes and sweeping meadows</strong> , making it one of the finest regions in the world for hiking. The Bavarian Alps have their own particular charms, with picturesque, historic villages, spectacular views, and lots of opportunities for outdoor activities and adventure sports. However, for their drama, diversity, and stunning wildflowers, we think that the Austrian Alps might have the edge.
